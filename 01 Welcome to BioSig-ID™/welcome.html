<p><em>Before starting your first class assignment, please create your BioSig-ID™ password.</em></p>
<p>As a public institution that has attained regional accreditation and receives federal funding, Boise State University
    must comply with certain standards. For example, the university is required to maintain academic and program
    integrity and an effective identity verification process for students enrolled in distance education courses and
    programs.
</p>
<p>This online course uses a password-based student identity verification process from Biometric Signature ID and we
    will be asking you for feedback about this new process. From time to time, verification of identity will be required
    to access Blackboard course content and graded activities like quizzes.</p>
<p>In those instances, you should use your
    BioSig-ID™ password for the device you are using at the time - or, if you forget that password, your Click-ID™
    password. The password will be compared to your BioSig-ID™ records. Only if the biometric patterns match will the
    “legitimate user” gain access. Please use your
    best efforts each time you verify.</p>
<p>Look for the BioSig-ID™ image <img style="margin: 0px 5px;" alt="BSI logo"
                                      src="https://blackboard.boisestate.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/eCampus/Program%20Resources/BioSig-ID/img/bsi-logo-sm-2.png"
                                      width="40"/> in your weekly learning content or when you are prompted
    automatically. All BioSig-ID™
    activity takes place in a Blackboard course.</p>
